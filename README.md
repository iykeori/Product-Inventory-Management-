# Product-Inventory-Management-
an Inventory Management software application to manage “Products” 
Company, ABC Ltd. Would need an Inventory Management software application to manage “Products” and “Sales” as they face increased patronage.

A few times they had no option but to take in “Returned Sales”; i.e. sales made to a “Customer” but are returned to the company’s sales department for some “reasons”.

The admin would want to know with a click of a button:
1.	The inventory balances
2.	Sales
3.	Returned Sales

OPTIONAL:
They’d like to manage their revenue too. They may have multiple revenue channels one of which would be sales “Revenue”.

After a sale id recorded, a revenue from same sale is logged with a channel tag: “SALES” (Incoming).

Whenever there’s an expense, a revenue is logged with channel tag: “EXPENSES” (Outgoing).
Bear in mind that returned sales would be logged with channel tag: “RETURNED SALES” (Outgoing).

4.	Calculate the total revenue
5.	Calculate actual revenue i.e Incoming less Outgoing.
